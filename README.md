In the early months of 2025 while at school, everyone that was enrolled into Illinois State University(including staff) got a spam email sent with a link to click on.
This email somehow got through spam dectection.  My project idea that came to mind was some sort of app extention that can further block/delete these spam messages from getting into people's inboxes.
